# Anti-Pacman
Anti-Pacman is a game, much like the PacMan game, but instead of Pacman, you have control over the ghosts. And you can control them by pressing keys 1, 2, 3, and 4. You can move the chosen ghost by w, s, a, and d keys.

You also can define levels for this game as well. The code is implemented in javafx.
